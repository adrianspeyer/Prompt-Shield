## 💡 Why Use Watermarks?

Zero-width watermarks provide an invisible trail if students paste instructions into AI systems. Combined with subtle bait phrases, this helps indicate whether AI tools were used to generate submissions.

## ⚖️ Important Notes

- Scores above 5/10 suggest moderate to high likelihood of AI involvement.
- This tool does **not** definitively prove AI use; always consider context and additional evidence.
- Designed as a research and educational aid — not a disciplinary instrument on its own.
